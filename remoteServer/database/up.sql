INSERT into songs values ('Muse', 'Won''t Stand Down', '13.01.2022',  'I never believed that I would concede
And let someone trample on me
You strung me along, I thought I was strong
But you were just gaslighting me

I''ve opened my eyes, and counted the lies
And now it is clearer to me
You are just a user and an abuser
Living vicariously

I never believed that I would concede
And get myself blown asunder
You strung me along, I thought I was strong
But now you have pushed me under

I''ve opened my eyes and counted the lies
And now it is clearer to me
You are just a user and an abuser
And I refuse to take it

Won''t stand down
I''m growing stronger
Won''t stand down
I''m owned no longer
Won''t stand down
You''ve used me for too long
Now die alone

Now I''m coming back, a counterattack
I''m playing you at your own game
I''m cutting you out, a shadow of doubt
Is gonna hang over your name

I''ve opened my eyes, I see your disguise
I will never see you the same
I know how to win, before you begin
I''ll shoot you before you take aim

Now I''m coming back, a counterattack
A psychological war
I''m cutting you in, I''m under your skin
Now I''m gonna settle the score

I''ve opened my eyes, I see your disguise
I will never see you the same
I know how to win, before you begin
I''ll shoot you before you take aim

Won''t stand down
I''m growing stronger
Won''t stand down
I''m owned no longer
Won''t stand down
You''ve used me for too long
Now die alone

(Won''t stand down)
(Breaking out)
(Won''t stand down)

Won''t stand down
I''m growing stronger
Won''t stand down
I''m owned no longer
Won''t stand down
You''ve used me for too long
Now die alone

INSERT into songs values ('Stone Sour', 'Through Glass', '22.07.2006',  'I''m looking at you through the glass
Don''t know how much time has passed
Oh God, it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

''Cause I''m looking at you through the glass
Don''t know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
When no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

How do you feel? That is the question
But I forget you don''t expect an easy answer
When something like a soul becomes initialized
And folded up like paper dolls and little notes
You can''t expect a bit of hope
So while you''re outside looking in
Describing what you see
Remember what you''re staring at is me

''Cause I''m looking at you through the glass
Don''t know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
When no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

How much is real? So much to question
An epidemic of the mannequins
Contaminating everything
We thought came from the heart
It never did right from the start
Just listen to the noises
(Null and void instead of voices)
Before you tell yourself
It''s just a different scene
Remember it''s just different from what you''ve seen

I''m looking at you through the glass
Don''t know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever
When no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

''Cause I''m looking at you through the glass
Don''t know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever
When no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

And it''s the stars
The stars that shine for you
And it''s the stars
The stars that lie to you, yeah-ah
And it''s the stars
The stars that shine for you
And it''s the stars
The stars that lie to you, yeah-ah

I''m looking at you through the glass
Don''t know how much time has passed
Oh God, it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

''Cause I''m looking at you through the glass
Don''t know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head
And it''s the stars

The stars that shine for you, yeah-ah
And it''s the stars
The stars that lie to you, yeah-ah
And it''s the stars
The stars that shine for you, yeah-ah
And it''s the stars
The stars that lie to you, yeah, yeah

Who are te stars
Who are the stars, they lie
